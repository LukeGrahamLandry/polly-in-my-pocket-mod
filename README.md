# Polly In My Pocket

- forge/fabric 1.18.2

A minecraft mod that lets you pickup your pets by shift right clicking them. Which animals can be picked up is set based on the `pollyinmypocket:pickup` tag (parrots, cats and dogs by default). 
If the animal extends `TamableAnimal`, only the owner may pick it up.
